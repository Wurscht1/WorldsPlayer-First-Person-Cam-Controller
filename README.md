# WorldsPlayer FPS Cam Controller

This currently buggyProject will compile into an .DLLL, once injected (e.g. CheatEngine) it will allow you to press 'F' (kinda buggy, might need multiple tries)
to enable the new FPS Cam Controller, press 'F' again to disable it, I used VisualStudio 2022 to build it.
Apologies to carterjones if I messed something up LICENSE wise...
